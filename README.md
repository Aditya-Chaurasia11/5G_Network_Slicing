# 5G Network Slicing Simulation Project
Welcome to the 5G Network Slicing Simulation project! This repository contains a comprehensive simulation framework to study network slicing in 5G networks, addressing key aspects like resource allocation, mobility management, QoS enforcement, and statistical analysis. Below you'll find a detailed overview of the project, its components, and the underlying theories applied.

# 📚 Project Overview
Introduction
Network slicing is a transformative technology in 5G networks, allowing multiple virtual networks to coexist on a shared physical infrastructure. Each network slice can be customized to meet specific requirements, enabling efficient resource utilization and providing tailored QoS guarantees. 

This project simulates a 5G network environment with multiple base stations, clients, and network slices, focusing on:
1. **Resource Allocation**: Efficiently distributing bandwidth among slices.
2. **Mobility Management**: Tracking and maintaining client connectivity as they move.
3. **QoS Management**: Ensuring specific performance levels for different slices.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Collecting and analyzing data to evaluate network performance
